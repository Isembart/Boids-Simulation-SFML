## Description
Flock simulation using boids algorithm. Coded in C++ and using SFML library for graphics.
To optimize the algorithm I used quadtrees.

Here's how it looks:

## Installation 
Example installation command using Unix Makefiles generator
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isembart/Boids-Simulation-SFML.git
cd Boids-Simulation-SFML
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
# If you want boids to have textures you need to move "arrow.png" file from the root folder to folder with the executable
```
